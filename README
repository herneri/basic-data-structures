This is a library of basic data structure functionality
(insertion and deletion), with integers being the data that is stored.

The purpose of this is to demonstrate one of my implementations of
data structures in C. It also serves as a basic template that I can work
with in the event that I need any of these.

Available data structures:
Linked List
Stack and Queue
Tree
